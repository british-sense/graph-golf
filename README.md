Graph Golf is an so-called _order/degree problem_.

The _order/degree problem_ with parameters n and d: Find a graph with minimum diameter over all undirected graphs with the number of vertices = n and degree ≤ d. If two or more graphs take the minimum diameter, a graph with minimum average shortest path length (ASPL) over all the graphs with the minimum diameter must be found.
